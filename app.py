    # The problem I initally had was that I was using a black pen in the HTML so when convert the 
    # image to greyscale there would be no distinct values (E.g All 0's) To solve this I have used a strong red pen which solves the problem.
    # However this wasn't enough, as the image would be still gray and not strong enough for comparision.
    # From my experience as a graphic designer I knew that increasing the threshold of an image would solve this.
    # I wanted to use all the methods from Pillow's so I researched how to increase the threshold of an image 
    # and found the point method which uses a lambda to increase the threshold if not black, so grey becomes solid white.
